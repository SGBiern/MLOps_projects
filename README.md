# Projects

- ## **Project_1: Predict Customer Churn with clean code [(`customer-churn`)](https://github.com/SGBiern/MLOps_projects/tree/master/predict-customer-churn-with-clean-code)**</br>

    In this project, I build a Python package for a machine learning to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The project follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).</br>


- ## **Project_2: Build an ML Pipeline for Short-term Rental Prices in NYC [(`mlops-pipeline`)](https://github.com/SGBiern/MLOps_projects/tree/master/build-ml-pipeline-for-short-term-rental-prices)**</br>

    In this project, I build a **Machine Learning Pipeline** end to end. The Pipeline contains the follows steps: Download data, Data visualization (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Testing, Initial Training, Pipeline release and updates. The project overview simulates that I am working for a property management company renting rooms and properties for short periods of time on various platforms. I need estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. The company receives new data in bulk every week. The model needs to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.</br>
    
    
- ## **Project_3: Deploy ML model on Heroku with FastAPI [(`mlops-deploy-heroku-FastAPI`)](https://github.com/SGBiern/MLOps_projects/tree/master/deploying-ml-model-on-heroku-with-fastAPI)**</br>
